# Drawbot_image_to_gcode_v2
<img src="pics/github1.png" height="411" alt="Drawbot_image_to_gcode_v2 example output"/>

This code is used to generate gcode for drawbots, polargraphs or other vertical drawing machines. \
It takes an original image, manipulates it and generates a drawing path that kinda sorta looks like the original image. \
This code was specifically written to work with multiple Copic markers. \
The code was intended to be heavily modified to generate different and unique drawing styles.

If your clipboard contains a URL to an image, the code will download it.  This makes finding usable images easy and straight forword.
If your clipboard contains a URL to a web site, the code will crash and burn in a spectacular fashion.
